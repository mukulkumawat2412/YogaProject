          “The yoga pose is not the goal. Being flexible or standing on the hands is not the goal.
          <br /><br />
          The goal is to create space where you were once stuck. To unveil layers of protection you’ve built around your heart.
          To appreciate your body and become aware of the mind and the noise it creates. To make peace with who you are.
          The goal is to love, well, you. Change your focus and your heart will grow.”
